        <p style="font-family: arial;">Welcome to TheRomanWorld.com a website dedicated to easily providing information of the Histoy of the Rome. Not just the events of the people who lived in it but the religion, geografy, political systums, economy, and the psycology of the people who lived there. For me finding a place online that was navicable enough to be able to find answers to what ever I wanted to know about rome was dificult. So because I couldnt find it I decided to make it. I codes this website from the ground up as a place for anyone to learn anything they want about this awesome topic. If there is something that you cant find on the site just email me <a href="mailto:Auror3501@gmail.com"> here</a> and it will be added.</p>
        <p style="font-family: arial">*And I know it looks like a mashed potato from the early 2000</p>
